-- Create storage policies for avatars bucket
-- This ensures authenticated users can upload directly to their own folder, providing a robust fallback if the edge function is bypassed or fails.

-- 1. Select policy: viewable by everyone
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "avatars_public_read" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "avatars_public_read"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- 2. Insert policy: authenticated user can upload to their own folder (folder name is their user id)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "avatars_insert_own" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "avatars_insert_own"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- 3. Update policy: authenticated user can update files in their own folder
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "avatars_update_own" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "avatars_update_own"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- 4. Delete policy: authenticated user can delete files in their own folder
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "avatars_delete_own" ON storage.objects;
CREATE POLICY "avatars_delete_own"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
